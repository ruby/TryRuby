This last section took a moment to wind down, to give you some pointers as to how you can use Ruby.

If you enjoyed yourself, you can continue with the <a href="/TryRuby/playground">TryRuby Playground</a>
or download and install Ruby:
<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/" target="_blank">ruby-lang.org</a>

Once you have Ruby installed, you can create a file, let say _my\_first\_progam.rb_, with a text
editor, type some Ruby code and then run it by opening a command prompt and typing:

    ruby my_first_progam.rb

There are many (free) development tools available that combine an editor, file browser and a
'ruby-runner'.

## Celebrate
You really deserve a double-layer cake with double-double frosting and a guy playing one of those guitars that's a double guitar.
I mean you finished, you really did! No doubt about it, you're a __certified red-blooded smartiac!__

## More info
There are a couple of articles on this website. They can give you some pointers on where to
go from here.
