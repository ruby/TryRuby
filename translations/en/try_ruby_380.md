So far we have been running programs that only use things that we have typed ourselves.
Which is nice, I mean that _Odelaying_ was epic, but this is the internet era so it is about
time we included the rest of the world in our programming efforts.

Many, many, many websites are available that you can ask for information. For instance
this link will give you all current <a href="http://news.google.com/news/section?q=ruby&output=rss" target="_blank">Google news feeds</a>
about Ruby.

Your web browser will probably display it quite nicely for you. If you look at the source
(type: control-U) you will see a long string of strangely formatted text. In the Google example
it is in the __rss__ format.

### Formats
There are many other formats, with strange names, available and used on the web, like:
html, xml and json. Yes, even this very website uses a couple of these.

I have prepared a method for you that will fetch a list of the complete works of William
Shakespeare from the internet.
(Don't worry it actually comes from the same server that this website runs on, so
we're not bothering anyone.)

Get the data with:

    get_shakey
