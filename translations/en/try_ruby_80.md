And numbers are different from strings.

While you can use methods on any object in Ruby, some methods only work on certain types of things.
But you can always convert between different types using Ruby's "to" methods.

- __to_s__ converts things to __s__trings
- __to_i__ converts things to __i__ntegers (numbers)
- __to_a__ converts things to __a__rrays

__What are arrays?!__

They are lists. Type in a pair of brackets: 

    []
