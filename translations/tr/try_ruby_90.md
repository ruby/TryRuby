Let's look at what you've learned in the first minute.

### The editor
Typing code into the editor and clicking on run gives you an answer in the output window.
(Almost) all code gives an answer.

### Numbers and strings
Numbers and strings are Ruby's math and text objects.

### Methods
You've used English-language methods like reverse and length. And symbolic methods like the
multiplication method: \*  
__Methods mean action!__

This is the essence of your learning. Taking simple things, toying with them and turning them into
new things. Feeling comfortable yet? I promise you are.

## Okay,
let's do something uncomfortable. Try reversing a number:

    40.reverse
