Lists (arrays) store things __in some order__.

Like standing in line for popcorn. You are behind someone and you wouldn't dream of pushing them aside,
right? And the guy behind you, you've got a close eye on him, right?

Here's a list for you. Lottery numbers: 

    [12, 47, 35]

Try adding a number to this list: type a comma after 35 followed by a number. The space is optional.
