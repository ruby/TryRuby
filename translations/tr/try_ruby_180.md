Now, look how your second minute went:

### Errors
If you try to reverse a number or do anything fishy, Ruby will tell you so.

### Arrays
Arrays are lists for storing things in some order.
We also know how to create arrays and get items from arrays.

### Variables
Variables save a thing and give it a name. You used the equals sign to do this. Like:
ticket = [14, 37, 18].

### 2/8
In all there are eight sections. You are two-eighths of the way there! This is simple stuff,
don't you think? Good stuff up ahead.

Let's change directions for a moment. I've stuffed a bit of poetry for you in a certain variable.
Take a look. Type:

    puts poem
