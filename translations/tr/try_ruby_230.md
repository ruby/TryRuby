### Exclamations
Methods may have exclamations (and also question marks) in their name.
These are just there to better explain what their function is. No big deal.

### String manipulation
Search and change strings

### Chaining
Chaining methods lets you get a lot more done. Break up a poem, reverse it, reassemble it:
__poem.lines.reverse.join__

At this point, you may want to tinker with the poem a bit more. A complete list of all the String
methods is <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core/classes/String.html" target="_blank">here</a>.

Go ahead and try a few, such as: poem.downcase or poem.swapcase

## Ready?
When you feel ready to move on, type:

    books = {}
