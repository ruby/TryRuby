title:  Are You Harsh?
answer: "mediocre"
load:   books = {"Gravitys Rainbow" => :splendid, "The deep end" => :abysmal, "Living colors" => :mediocre, "Bumblebees" => :mediocre}
ok:     Great, wow! You've made a scorecard of your ratings

So are you giving out harsh, unfair reviews? Let's keep score with a new hash __ratings__:

Then, okay, now let's count up your reviews. Just stay with me. Type:

    ratings = Hash.new {0}
    
    books.values.each { |rate|
      ratings[rate] += 1
    }
    
    puts ratings

The straight line in the code is the pipe character, probably located right above the Enter key
on your keyboard.

That _+= 1_ line means: increase the value by 1.

Don't worry if you don't understand everything that is going on here. It will be revealed later.
