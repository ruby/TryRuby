You're a level six Ruby cleric. I mean what a great job you've done. Let's review:


### Data
You loaded some data off the internet, traversed a data structure and selected values.

### Iterating
You iterated all elements of a hash and you chained some more methods.

### Pretty printing
And if that wasn't enough, you formatted and printed some values in a way that is easy
to read for humans. In fact __you made a real program!__

### IF
You learned to take control of your programs with __if__ and __else__ statements.

## So
What could possibly be next? What could you possibly have to learn now?
Ha, this is the best part. You've come such a long way that we're going
to uncover classes. For two more short lessons and you're done.

Earlier, we created a hash like this:

    Hash.new
