Hey, okay, you done it. You're making your own method. You started with def, followed by the name of the method.
And a list of arguments which the method will need. This isn't too scary and dangerous!
All we have to do is fill it up with Ruby and finish it up with end.

Here's the code:
    
    def tame( number_of_shrews )
      number_of_shrews.times {
        puts "Tamed a shrew"
      }
    end
