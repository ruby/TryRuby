You've opened up a new Blurb<sup>TM</sup> class. What is your blog entry made of?
The content, sure. Also, a time when the Blurb<sup>TM</sup> was posted. And a mood.

Okay, so you've got the first line of the class, here's the rest:

    class Blurb
      attr_accessor :content, :time, :mood
    end

Class names always begin with a capital letter.

(Still no output)
