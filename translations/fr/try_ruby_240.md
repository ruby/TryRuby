You've made an empty __hash__. A hash is like an array, only every one of its elements has a name.

We're going to stuff some miniature book reviews in our new hash. Here's our rating system:

- :splendid &rarr; a masterpiece
- :quite\_good &rarr; enjoyed, sure, yes
- :mediocre &rarr; equal parts great and terrible
- :quite\_not\_good &rarr; notably bad
- :abysmal &rarr; steaming wreck

To rate a book, put the title in square brackets and put the rating after the equals. For example:

    books["Gravitys Rainbow"] = :splendid

> By now I think it is only fair to tell you that all lessons in TryRuby are separate from each other.
> So if you go crazy typing book reviews here, you can only use 'em in this lesson.  
> If you want to use your reviews in the next lesson you should copy/paste them.  
> Don't worry about this too much, each lesson has plenty of predefined stuff for you to play around with.
