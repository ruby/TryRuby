Aha, you're here. And all in one piece. We're still going to make your app real,
but until then, let's review, okay?

### Classes
Everything in Ruby is some kind of object. Classes explain objects, how a certain object works.
For example, you made a few Blurb<sup>TM</sup> objects and these objects are explained in the Blurb
class.
In other words: you call them Blurb objects.
You can use classes to (kinda) model real life objects.

### Accessors
Accessors are variables attached to an object which can be used __outside__ the object.
(blurb2.time = Time.now)

### Object variables
Object variables are the same variables you're using for accessors, but __inside__ the object.
(@time = Time.now)
