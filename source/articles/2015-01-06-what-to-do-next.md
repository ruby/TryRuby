## What's next ?
So, you finished the TryRuby lessons. Are you hungry for more ?

You can use the
<a href="/playground">TryRuby Playground</a>
or download and install Ruby:
<a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/" target="_blank">ruby-lang/downloads</a>

Try to make a couple of simple programs:

- Find all permutations of strings you can make with the letters r, u, b and y
- _IO.Read_ a text file, count the frequency of each word in the file
- Write a program that shows all prime numbers between 1 and 100
- Implement a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort" target="_blank">bubble-sort algorithm</a>
- Create a Rock, paper, scissors game

You can find websites with lots more ideas (and suggested solutions) for coding problems.

Maybe you can read a book on Ruby. I'm not giving any suggestions since I want to remain
impartial.

Follow an online course, of which there are many. And many are also free.

Regardless what you do, you will find the Ruby
<a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/core/" target="_blank">documentation</a>
an invaluable resource.


## Real applications
The example app Twatify<sup>TM</sup> only showed the bare bones of setting up an application.
Moreover it combined storing- and displaying of content. In practice these tasks are
split up between a back-end application (Rails would be an excellent choice for this) and a
front-end (usually a web browser or an app on your smartphone).

So if you want to create the next killer app, be sure to read all information on this website
first.  
There are a couple of articles on this website on specific topics like:

### Left-out
Which topics were left out of the course to keep it compact and simple.

### Rails
I should mention _Ruby on Rails_. You have been learning the Ruby language, how to speak it.
But Rails is a very powerful and popular toolkit for building websites.
See the _Web development_ article.

### Ruby here, Ruby there
Today, you can use Ruby everywhere, on the Desktop, web browser, smartphone or in the cloud.
See the _Is there an App for that_ article.
